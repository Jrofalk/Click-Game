# Rose Tattoo Click Game

This is a simple click game that was created using React for the user interface.

A user is presented with a series of rose tattoo images. The user clicks on one of the images, increasing the counter at the top by one. This further causes the images to be rearranged randomly. If the user clicks on the same image twice, the counter is returned to zero, starting the game over.
